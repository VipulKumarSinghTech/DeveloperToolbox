# Developer Toolbox

Welcome to Developer Toolbox, a collection of essential tools for developers. This toolbox provides five fundamental functionalities to aid developers in their daily tasks.
Tools

### 1. Base 64 Conversion

Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that converts binary data into a ASCII string format, which is useful for transferring or storing data that may not be easily represented in plain text. This tool in Developer Toolbox provides two main functionalities:

* **Encoding:** Converts plaintext into base64 encoded text. This is useful for encoding data such as binary files or encrypted data into a format that can be easily transmitted over text-based protocols.

* **Decoding:** Converts base64 encoded text back into plaintext. This allows you to retrieve the original data from its base64 encoded form.

### 2. Epoch Conversion

Epoch time, also known as Unix time or POSIX time, is a system for tracking time in computing systems. It represents the number of seconds that have elapsed since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC). This tool in Developer Toolbox allows you to:

* **Convert Epoch Milliseconds:** Takes a timestamp in milliseconds since the Unix epoch and converts it into a human-readable date format, typically in the form of YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.

### 3. JWT Decoder

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. They are commonly used for authentication and information exchange in web applications. This tool in Developer Toolbox helps you decode JWT tokens into their constituent parts:

* **Header:** Contains metadata about the token such as the type of token and the signing algorithm used.

* **Payload:** Contains the claims or assertions about the user or system being authenticated.

* **Signature:** A cryptographic signature that ensures the integrity of the token and verifies its authenticity.

### 4. UUID Generator

A UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is a 128-bit number used to uniquely identify information in computer systems. They are typically represented as a sequence of 32 hexadecimal digits, such as "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000". This tool in Developer Toolbox allows you to generate random UUIDs:

* **Random Generation:** Generates a new, randomly generated UUID each time the tool is invoked. These UUIDs are designed to be unique across space and time, making them suitable for use as unique identifiers in various applications.

### 5. JSON Formatter

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. However, raw JSON data can be difficult to read and understand, especially when it's not properly formatted. This tool in Developer Toolbox helps you format raw JSON data into a prettier, more readable format:

* **Prettify JSON:** Takes raw JSON data as input and formats it with proper indentation, line breaks, and spacing, making it easier to read and comprehend. This is particularly useful for debugging JSON data or for improving its readability in logs or output messages.
